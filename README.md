<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![QJsonify on Linux][product-screenshot-linux]](https://github.com/NucleaPeon/QJsonify)
[![QJsonify on OS X Snow Leopard][product-screenshot-osx]](https://github.com/NucleaPeon/QJsonify)
[![QJsonify on Windows 7][product-screenshot-win7]](https://github.com/NucleaPeon/QJsonify)

_A Windows XP and 7 version are planned._

QJsonify is a project that aims to help developers keep their data local. There are many great online JSON minifiers and prettifiers, but all that functionality is easily accessible within the Qt5 Framework and this avoids submitting data across the network.

It's faster and more secure, you can toggle quickly between minified and prettified forms as well as print and export said json files in a couple clicks.

This project includes Oxygen Icons <a href="https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Oxygen/Licensing">https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Oxygen/Licensing</a> which are licensed under the LGPL v3 (see LICENSE-LGPL3 file). All files under this license are located in the ``icons/`` directory except jsonify-* files which I created for the program logo. These also can be licensed under the LGPL v3.

The oxygen repo is old when checked out, some svg/svgz files may not be available for inclusion with the project. Latest commit is ``bff159d338fe08be09146a5ee17b9b6efa8a2c8d``. See https://github.com/KDE/oxygen-icons for latest repo commits.

* format-line-spacing-triple.svg*

### Built With

This project is built on a minimum Qt5 version of Qt 5.3.2. For OS X 10.6.8, you can download the Qt5 binary at my <a href="https://github.com/NucleaPeon/qt5-sle/releases/tag/v5.3.2">other repository</a>.

It is also tested using Qt5.15 on Linux amd64.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NucleaPeon/QJsonify.git
```

### Prerequisites

You will need:
* git
* cmake (for CMake builds)
* clang >= 3 OR g++ >= 4.2 OR msvc 
* make (OS X and Linux)
* Qt5 >= 5.3.2 (Though 5.3.1 **may** also be acceptable)
* For Windows 7:
	* Visual Studio with MSBuild.exe on your ``PATH`` (I'm using VS 2013)
	* Windows Driver Version kit (I'm using 7.1.0)
	* Git Bash is useful for cli builds
	* Ensure that Qt5_DIR environmental variable is set to something like ``C:\Qt\Qt5.3.1\5.3\msvc2013_opengl`` or ``C:\Qt\Qt5.3.2\5.3\msvc2013_64_opengl``
	* Ensure your path to windeployqt is on ``PATH`` (``C:\Qt\Qt5.3.1\5.3\msvc2013_opengl\Bin``)


### Installation

**Note** I recommend calling ``make -jN`` where ``N`` is the number of cores of your cpu.

<hr>

* Using cmake on Linux or Mac:

    ```sh
	cd  build/
	cmake ..
	make
	```

* For linux:

    ```sh
    cd QJsonify
    qmake -r
    make
    ```

* For Mac:

    ```sh
    cd QJsonify
    qmake -r
    make
    ```

    Then drag and drop the resulting QJsonify.app/ folder into your Applications folder.

* For Windows 7 on Visual Studio 2013

Easiest way is to open project in Qt Creator and build, then navigate to directory, copy over .dll's or run ``windeployqt QJsonify.exe``

For ``cmake`` use Git Bash on main project directory. Not specifying the ``Configuration`` parameter will build the Debug release by default:
	```sh
	cd build
	cmake ..
	# Define Debug or Release for build type. "//" to specify an option is required for git bash, but only "/" for cmd.exe or powershell.
	MSBuild.exe QJsonify.sln //p:Configuration="Debug"
	windeployqt Debug/QJsonify.exe
	```
	
Compress the Release/ or Debug/ directory and distribute.
	

Slightly less easy way and one I'm not supporting is using ``qmake`` on the command line:

	```sh
	qmake -r
	jom.exe -f Makefile.Release
	windeployqt QJsonify.exe
	```
	
	or use VS nmake (not as optimized for multi-core)
	
	```sh
	qmake -r
	nmake.exe -f Makefile.Release
	windeployqt QJsonify.exe
	```
	
I couldn't get things to compile, so perhaps my environmental variables were not set up correctly. It would fail looking for "utility".
If you want to try the above method, you can view your Environmental Variables in Qt Creator -> Projects sidebar button and make sure
everything is set up correctly.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Remote file read and write
- [ ] Compile for, and add Windows 7 binary
- [ ] Implement Recent Files menu and have ability to clear it
- [ ] Use CMake as the build system instead of qmake
- [ ] Create a debian release package
- [ ] Show statistics between prettified and minified file sizes
- [ ] Have an editor button to allow system editor to edit json file

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

Please remember to avoid any c++11 code and any Qt 5.4.0+ introduced functions for ``Q_OS_MAC`` def blocks as this project must be compatible with Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.8).

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, either create an issue with your idea(s) or fork the repo and create a pull request.

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!
