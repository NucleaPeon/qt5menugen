Version 3.0.2
=============

* Removed debugging info

Version 3.0.1
=============

* Fixed toolbar spacing due to too many separators being added to the toolbar.

Version 3.0.0
=============

* Constructor that takes in multiple string paths to work around osx bug where toolbar items
  not being added on update() (after initial construction of toolbars).
  This allows multiple files to be used for organization and reference later. Option to add
  separators between each file automatically for nicer toolbar spacing.

* This release is big enough to require a major release increment. We also store the entire
  defined QJsonObject within the QAction (from the json file for that object) so we can
  retrieve slot information when we convert QActions to Q{Tool,Push}Buttons.

* We store the slotobj so we can refer to things later, simplifying method signatures.
  update() does not utilize the old slotobj, in case user wants to have things call a
  different QObject slot set. We do not store this update() slotobj anywhere so it's
  expected to be more of a one-off thing.

Version 2.3.2
=============

* See github issue #3, there was a problem with update() not adding toolbar items on OS X.
  The purpose of using update() is to allow users to have multiple json files to reuse
  definitions. With OS X, adding things to the toolbar after setup means they don't show
  up, even if they are available in the Customize Toolbar option.
* Added a constructor to take multiple QString parameters in a list so multiple json files
  can be used to create menus. This overcomes the OS X limitation (it only affects QMacToolBar,
  not the global menu system) in a way that's not too complicated, verbose or requiring
  duplicating work.

Version 2.3.1
=============

* Fixed things on the Linux/Windows side, there was a segfault occuring due to some bad
  variable refences.

Version 2.3.0
=============

* Allow users to reuse json-defined QtMenuGen* objects within other QtMenuGen* objects.
* This release, while a minor version / feature increment, is considered a bit unstable as
  it modifies a good portion of the base code. Some things are not yet working.
    * I plan to include taking the json contents and adding it to an existing menu or action, but
      currently it only updates to the end of the existing menus.
      For example, If you have some menus you want added to the menu bar, they get added after
      everything else. If you have: [ File | Edit | Help ], then adding [ Tools ] would go to the
      end and be seen like: [ File | Edit | Help | Tools ], which may not be desirable.
  * I have not tested this on windows/linux yet, only OS X 10.6.8.
  * Another pitfall is if you update with an UpdateTypes enum value of MENU, the library expects you
    to take the returned QMenu* and deal with it yourself; it does not automatically add it anywhere.
  * the secondary update() with InjectionType enum does not work yet.

Version 2.2.0
=============

* Added the ability to add submenus (even empty ones) by including the actions[] array in a json object
