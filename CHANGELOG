Version 2.3.0
=============

* Allow users to reuse json-defined QtMenuGen* objects within other QtMenuGen* objects.
* This release, while a minor version / feature increment, is considered a bit unstable as
  it modifies a good portion of the base code. Some things are not yet working.
    * I plan to include taking the json contents and adding it to an existing menu or action, but
      currently it only updates to the end of the existing menus.
      For example, If you have some menus you want added to the menu bar, they get added after
      everything else. If you have: [ File | Edit | Help ], then adding [ Tools ] would go to the
      end and be seen like: [ File | Edit | Help | Tools ], which may not be desirable.
  * I have not tested this on windows/linux yet, only OS X 10.6.8.
  * Another pitfall is if you update with an UpdateTypes enum value of MENU, the library expects you
    to take the returned QMenu* and deal with it yourself; it does not automatically add it anywhere.
  * the secondary update() with InjectionType enum does not work yet.

Version 2.2.0
=============

* Added the ability to add submenus (even empty ones) by including the actions[] array in a json object
